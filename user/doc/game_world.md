# Game World

[INPUT_HINT]

The game world is composed of terrains (land and swamp) and buildings (harbor and shrub).

A land is represented by a thick dash or a plus symbol. They have no in-game differences. The plus symbol makes it easier for players to measure the distance. A swamp is always shown as a thin dash.

A harbor has five states (see Player Character). Each state has its own symbol. An unlighted harbor is an empty circle, while a lighted one is a solid circle. A closed harbor is an empty or solid triangle. When in Sight Mode, if a closed harbor will become accessible in no more than 9 turns, the triangle is replaced by a number.

A shrub is displayed as a sharp symbol. There is an uppercase letter R in one of the four corners of the dungeon, which is a special shrub. The harbor beside it is your final destination.
