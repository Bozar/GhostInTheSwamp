## About This Game

Ghost in the Swamp is a turn-based, coffee break Roguelike game made with Godot engine. A successful round takes about 5 to 10 minutes. The source code is available on GitHub. The file icon is downloaded from Flaticon. The GUI font, Fira Code, is created by Nikita Prokopov. The tileset, curses_vector, is created by DragonDePlatino for Dwarf Fortress. You can play Ghost in the Swamp either locally (which is an executable file) or as an HTML5 game on itch.io.

## Story Background

> The swamp is vast and infinite.

You are the half-ghost guardian of a peaceful swamp. Humans invaded your homeland and stole three precious treasures. You need to spook invaders, retrieve lost items, and finally hide them away in Risky Boots' secret island. You lose the game if you are exposed in human sight without Mana Points, sink in the swamp, or cannot take any valid actions.

## Export the Game

If you want to export Ghost in the Swamp using Godot engine by yourself, first you need to download the project from GitHub. You also have to tweak export settings to filter certain files. In the GitHub repository, refer to `misc/export.md` for more information.
